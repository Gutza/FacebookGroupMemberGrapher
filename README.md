# What is this?

This is a really simple tool which allows you to generate graphs showing who invited whom on your Facebook groups.
You need administrative access to the group you want to graph.

# How does it do that?

This is just a parser for "dead" text, and it works offline.
There is no online tool that needs access to your group or account, this is 100% DIY on your computer.

# Using this app

TBD
